# Pipeline Edge Cases with default-missing
#
# Note: Pipelines with missing vars that don't have 'default' will fail
# because pipeline functions execute before default-missing replacement.
# Use Sprig's 'default' function in the pipeline for missing values.

# Direct missing var (no pipeline) - works with default-missing
Name: N/A

# Pipeline with Sprig default (default wins over global default-missing)
DbHost: localhost

# Pipeline with Sprig default then transformations
Status: "UNKNOWN"

# Nested missing with default in pipeline
ServiceName: app

# Mixed: some values present, some with defaults
Environment: dev
Region: us-east-1
